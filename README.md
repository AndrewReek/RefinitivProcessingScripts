# RefinitivProcessingScripts

The workbooks of this repository are used to process the LSEG (Refinitiv) firm financial data commonly used by the Management Accounting Research Group of the Philipps University Marburg.

The scripts were last used in Summer of 2022 and are not ready for scaling. Adjustments are needed to implement with more recent financial data.
